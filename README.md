# Birthday-wisher

This program's main use is to send a mail through python from your mail_ID to the one's mail to whom you want to send birthday wishes. In this repository, I have a attached a file called 'birthdays.csv' in which you can enter your family members or friends name, email and date of birth. In the main.py file, you need to mention your email_id and password and your mail smtp address ( If it is of gmail it will have one smtp address, if it is of yahoo it will have a different smtp address and so on). 

Note: I recommend you to create a new email of your choice for this purpose because we need to lower the security in the email settings for the code to execute and run smoothly.

You need to allow less secure app access if it for Gmail or  you need to generate a password if it is of Yahoo (If you have any doubts regarding this please mail me)

You can automate this program by running it everyday by placing it on a cloud server (like pythonanywhere)

In letter_template foldeer you will see some text files. In all those files replace the last line with your name
